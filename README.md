# Parameter Optimization of SVM Using Dry Bean Dataset

## Assingment 5

### 1. Number of Instances: 13611

### 2. Number of Attributes: 17

### 3. Attribute Information:<br>

1.) Area (A): The area of a bean zone and the number of pixels within its boundaries.<br>
2.) Perimeter (P): Bean circumference is defined as the length of its border.<br>
3.) Major axis length (L): The distance between the ends of the longest line that can be drawn from a bean.<br>
4.) Minor axis length (l): The longest line that can be drawn from the bean while standing perpendicular to the main axis.<br>
5.) Aspect ratio (K): Defines the relationship between L and l.<br>
6.) Eccentricity (Ec): Eccentricity of the ellipse having the same moments as the region.<br>
7.) Convex area (C): Number of pixels in the smallest convex polygon that can contain the area of a bean seed.<br>
8.) Equivalent diameter (Ed): The diameter of a circle having the same area as a bean seed area.<br>
9.) Extent (Ex): The ratio of the pixels in the bounding box to the bean area.<br>
10.)Solidity (S): Also known as convexity. The ratio of the pixels in the convex shell to those found in beans.<br>
11.)Roundness (R): Calculated with the following formula: (4piA)/(P^2)<br>
12.)Compactness (CO): Measures the roundness of an object: Ed/L<br>
13.)ShapeFactor1 (SF1)<br>
14.)ShapeFactor2 (SF2)<br>
15.)ShapeFactor3 (SF3)<br>
16.)ShapeFactor4 (SF4)<br>
17.)Class (Seker, Barbunya, Bombay, Cali, Dermosan, Horoz and Sira)<br>
